tx: A simple utility to execute commands for a period of time

tx is a simple utility that executes a command for a period of time,
and then ending it by sending SIGINT after that time is up.

To install:
1. make
2. sudo make install

By default, tx will install itself to /usr/local/bin/. If you want
to put it in a different place, edit the Makefile. You can also
probably pass the variable INSTALLDIR as part of the command to
change where it is installed.

Usage:
tx -t <seconds> <command>
